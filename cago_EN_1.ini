Covalex_Danger_001=One more thing, I'm seeing here that you'll be working in a heightened safety area. I'm sure you always follow best practices, but a little extra caution probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Better safe than sorry, right!
Covalex_Danger_002=One last thing, it looks like some of our previous operators have reported outlaw activity in the area. Might be a good idea to plan for some extra security precautions. But if you do get into a situation (though you probably won't!), remember Covalex's policy of 'Flight, not fight.'
Covalex_Danger_003=Also, unfortunately, it seems a security flag has been placed on this contract. Nothing to worry about too much... but that said, you should probably at least be extra careful during this job. Be ready for anything and you'll never be surprised!
Covalex_Danger_004=One more little wrinkle. The system has flagged this contract as potentially hazardous. It might not mean anything, but don't be too surprised if you run into a bump or two or three while completing this one.
Covalex_Danger_005=Last thing. This contract has been given a security flag. They add those when there is a higher risk involved. Sometimes it's hazardous routes, sometimes outlaw sightings, but you're going to want to be extra sharp on this one.

Covalex Shipping is not responsible for any damages that occur while operating as an independent contractor.
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_003=Hi,\n\nSo it seems that some forms got processed incorrectly and a shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address. Unfortunately, we only realized the mistake after the original transport ship left the system and now I need another pilot to correctly finish the delivery.\n\nThe reason why it would have been better for the original ship to take care of this is that delivery was quantum sensitive Diluthermex. Without the proper shielding, I'm afraid you'll have to make the deliveries without using your quantum drives or risk damaging the shipment (and your ship). \n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nBut hey, flying a little bit slower can be nice sometimes. Just think about all the pretty views! As long as you got a full tank of fuel, why not sit back and enjoy the flight. \n\nAppreciate your help,\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_001=You haven't been having much luck out there have you? I don't want to get too overly dramatic, but your performance stats over the last few contracts have been falling well below average. However, your luck hasn't completely run out! Covalex believes firmly in cultivating talent and allowing people to learn from our mistakes ( Thankfully! I probably wouldn't be here otherwise :p ). So, let's put all that behind us as a learning experience and meet the future head on!
Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_002=This is part of my job that I do not look forward to. We have to talk about your recent string of contracts. Things have just not been going your way have they? I'm not gonna sugar coat it, your performance stats are not look so hot. But you know what they say, nothing makes up for the past like the present. Let's get you back out there, and see what you can really do.
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Got to say, you really turned it around with that last job! Awesome work! Now, let's just keep it up!
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Congrats on the flipping your performance status around! I was rooting for you, and sure enough, you really proved on that last job that when push comes to shove, you can get it done. Now we just got to keep that momentum going!
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_001=Hate to do this, but wanted to check in about that last contract. Seems like you had some problems. Now, while we all run into unavoidable obstacles from time to time, I'm going to encourage you to take a moment to think about what went wrong and three things that you can improve upon for your next contract. It's a little exercise that always helps me improve my performance, and isn't that what life is about? Self improvement? All right, back to the exciting new business at hand!
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_002=To get a bit of business out of the way, I briefly wanted to mention your performance on the last contract. I have in my notes that it was less than satisfactory. Probably just an off day, and I sure know about those, but I would like to strongly encourage you to use this contract as an opportunity to show us just how good you really are.
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=I was looking back through my records and wow! You've been doing a fantastic job recently. I've talked about you to some of the other Jr. Logistics Operators, and you didn't hear it from me, but they're pretty jealous I'm working with such a stellar contractor. Keep this up and we'll both be Covalex stars!
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=First off, I want to let you know how much I, and everyone here at Covalex Shipping, really appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. You've consistently have been completing contracts above and beyond my expectations. All right, that's probably enough stroking your ego!
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=I'm going to confess, I was a little surprised seeing that report come in from your last contract. You had been doing so well! For now, let's just call it a fluke and focus on the next job, okay?
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=I have to ask - were you as disappointed about that last contract as I was? You had such a good record going! But don't worry. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what we do with those mistakes that matter. It's like that saying - "I'd rather try and fail, than fail to try."
Covalex_Reaction_Good_001=My records show that you did a great job with that last contract! I personally wanted to say well done. It's that kind of performance that Covalex really loves to see.
Covalex_Reaction_Good_002=Wanted to take a second to say that you did a stellar job with that last contract and that your hard work is not going unnoticed!
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So, with your recent performance issues, I'm afraid that if you don't turn things around, Covalex will be putting you on a probationary disciplinary period and remove you from active contractor status. But don't worry, this contract is you're chance show us how dedicated you are to meeting Covalex Shipping's high standards. I'm sure you'll do great.
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_002=There's a bit of bad news. I've received notice that your time with Covalex may be transitioning to a less 'active' role. Seems that your track record hasn't been all that satisfactory. Good news is that it's not too late for you to change people's minds! You knock this next contract into the goal, and it'll show you still have some tricks up your sleeves.
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_001=I know it's been a little while since we last spoke, but I'm happy to report that my manager has agreed to allow you to do another 'Evaluation Trial' to regain active status as a Covalex Independent Contractor. I'm a firm believer in giving people another chance to prove themselves, and this is yours!
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_002=I've got some good news. We were directed to go through our probationary contractors list and see if there were candidates who we felt deserved to be reconsidered. You immediately came to mind! What do you say? You ready to wipe the slate clean and give it another try?

System login indicates that Ward attempted another stress test at 1400 SET on day of accident, but didn’t ever turn the system off. Station systems went critical without the local failsafes and an explosion was inevitable.\n \nReviewing Ward’s personnel file indicated that he’d had addiction issues in the past and had even been suspended previously for negligence. Though supervisor reviews indicated he’d cleaned up since his return, our teams found evidence that he slipped back into bad habits shortly before the accident.\n \nTo perform our due diligence, we’ve exhausted other potential causes, but this one seems to be the most likely. As I mentioned, I’m still compiling my final report, which you will have when I make my presentation to the board.\n \n \nAva Skenning\nInvestigator\nCorporate Security - Covalex\n \n<i>The information contained in this message is confidential and only intended for the recipients.

I know the initial speculation was criminal sabotage, but based on this, it looked like worker negligence. Sad as it is to say.\n \nAnyway, I’ve attached a series of files to help illustrate my points and so you don’t have to sift through three million lines of data text.\n \n**/Excerpt_1 ATTACHED/**\n \nI’ve pulled together some sample readings from the Power Distribution logs. As you can see, over the past year, the station has been suffering from sporadic power drains. Maintenance reports theorized that there was a power drain somewhere, but to me, it looks like faulty switchers. These 2920’s were notorious for power flow issues.\n \n**/Excerpt_2 ATTACHED/**\n \nSo here is the initial stress test that Darnell Ward ran the day of the incident. Everything after <i>RUNPROTOCOL stresstest_v3.dnn</i> is the test taking effect. Everything looks good, right? Then, and I haven’t figured out why yet, but a few hours later (and in the middle of the stress test) he runs this <i>all_monitor_silence.dnn</i> protocol. Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know. Anyway, it was a stupid move, because he basically removed his only way to see that the power plant was about to go critical. \n \nI’ll keep digging and keep you apprised.\n \nDennis

Dr. Colby said that I shouldn’t get too down on myself if I stumbled in my treatment, but I can’t bring myself to believe him.

I think about all the things I put you, put the kids through, and I just don’t know why I can’t figure this out. \n \nI guess you know where this is going. There was a birthday party tonight and somebody had been saving a bottle of Esquire. It was easy to say yes. I almost didn’t even think about it. What that word would mean.

covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference) Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference) ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right?

That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it.

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to ~mission(Destination)?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to ~mission(Destination) so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

LingFamily_Danger_001=Also, some of the family has run into trouble doing similar contracts recently. I would be extra careful. You know it's dangerous when cousin Maggi even says it.
LingFamily_Danger_002=Also, a word of caution. I've got several reports highlighting this particular stretch as potentially dangerous. I don't think anything will happen, but just be ready in case trouble shows up.
LingFamily_Danger_003=One more thing. I don't want to raise a false alarm, but there's a small chance that this contract may wind up being riskier than usual. Nothing concrete, but I've got a contact in Crusader Security who gave me a heads up. Should be fine, but be careful.
LingFamily_Danger_004=And I probably don't have to say this, but Crusader's been having some security issues lately. It's not as safe as it once was, especially where you'll be going for this job. Be smart out there and stay safe.
LingFamily_Family_001=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but unfortunately his cooler blew. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can step in.
LingFamily_Family_002=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but his power plant's been having issues. He's getting it fixed, it'd be great if you can take this one.
LingFamily_Family_003=My brother, Ricki, was scheduled to handle this, but the quantum drive on his Lancer decided to stop working today. It's being repaired, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can handle it.
LingFamily_Family_004=My brother, Ricki, is down for the count today owing to his life support system being on its last breath. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can fill in.
LingFamily_Family_005=Ricki got caught up on the opposite side of Stanton doing a long haul, so we need someone else to handle this job.
LingFamily_Family_006=I originally had Ricki slated for this, but a leaky fuel line means he's not going to get back in time. Hopefully, you're available.
LingFamily_Family_007=Fabian, my cousin, commed in sick again. Guess his suit actuator failed while he was doing a drop on Yela and he caught a cold. So we need someone to pick up the slack today.
LingFamily_Family_008=Got a last minute comm from my cousin Fabian that he isn't feeling well again. Seems he picked up a stomach bug from a bad burrito and can't fly. Would be great if you could cover for him.
LingFamily_Family_009=Hoping that you'll be able to fill in for my cousin Fabian. Not sure exactly what happened, but seems like his arm is on the fritz and he can't fly till he sees a cybernetician. You'll definitely be helping us out if you're available.
LingFamily_Family_010=You ever hear of Dolphin Tongue? Well, my cousin Fabian woke up with it. Half his face is swollen to the size of burstmelon. Would you be free to take over for him today?
LingFamily_Family_011=My cousin Maggi had some trouble with the Nine Tails and is filing a report with Crusader right now. Of course, that could wind up taking all afternoon so I need someone to handle this job for her.
LingFamily_Family_012=I thought that my cousin Maggi was going to be able to do this one, but she has to chase down a missing order. Hoping that it wasn't stolen. Either way, she's going to be tied up for a while.
LingFamily_Family_013=Fabian caught a stomach bug and now the rest of the family seems to have got it. To be honest, I'm not feeling so great, but I'm hanging in for now. Since they're all busy making their own "deliveries" until the medicine kicks in, I was thinking you might be able to take care of this job.
LingFamily_Family_014=A bunch of the family headed over to New Babbage for the day to celebrate another cousin's birthday. And guess who didn't get to go? Anyway, still plenty of work around here that needs doing.

LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_002=Seems like you've been having a really hard time getting through these contracts. Last few jobs we've thrown you're way haven't exactly gone as planned. We're not a big company so these setbacks really hurt our bottom line. You're just going to have to do better, okay? Having said that...
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Guess you're a diamond in the rough, after all. Had a bet going with my sister Linda that you would screw up that last contract. Now I have to make her dinner, but hey, it's better than having to clean up your mess again. Anyway...
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Way to turn it around. I was getting worried about you, but that last contract showed you got potential. We'll have to see if you can keep it up...

RedWind_Delivery_Illegal_Desc_Intro=RED WIND LINEHAUL\n'YOUR GOODS IN GOOD HANDS'\n----------------------------\n\nI know you've done some solid work for us in the past, so I figured I'd see if you were interested in handling a bit of a special run for us that's a bit farther out in the system than what you've been doing so far.\n\nIn a nutshell, we need a pilot who's willing to keep their head down, focus on getting the packages delivered, and most importantly, not ask a lot of questions.\n\nSee, for a smaller company like us, staying ahead of competition means that we need to offer our clients something they can't get elsewhere - discretion. At Red Wind, as long as you got the credits we'll take whatever to wherever. Understand?\n\nIf that sounds good to you, let's see how you do on this run -\n\nPACKAGES FOR PICK UP (ANY ORDER)\n · Package <EM4>#~mission(Item1|SerialNumber)</EM4> from the <EM4>~mission(Pickup1|Address)</EM4>\n · Package <EM4>#~mission(Item2|SerialNumber)</EM4> from the <EM4>~mission(Pickup2|Address)</EM4>\n · Package <EM4>#~mission(Item3|SerialNumber)</EM4> from the <EM4>~mission(Pickup3|Address)</EM4>\n\nDROP OFF LOCATIONS (ANY ORDER)\n · Package <EM4>#~mission(Item1|SerialNumber)</EM4> to the <EM4>~mission(Dropoff1|Address)</EM4>\n · Package <EM4>#~mission(Item2|SerialNumber)</EM4> to the <EM4>~mission(Dropoff2|Address)</EM4>\n · Package <EM4>#~mission(Item3|SerialNumber)</EM4> to the <EM4>~mission(Dropoff3|Address)</EM4>\n\nOne last bit of advice, it would probably be good to avoid any unnecessary delays once you got the packages onboard, for example being searched by local law enforcement. \n
